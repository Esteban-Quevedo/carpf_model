# Car Power Factor ML Model

## Objective

This project aims to create a machine learning model called Car Power and make predictions on the power factor
using [BentoML](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/latest/ "BentoML Documentation") (“a framework for building reliable,
scalable and cost-efficient AI applications.”) and a free dataset
called [car_dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/willstr/car-salescsv "Dataset Source").

### Understanding and Analyzing the Data

The first resource is a Jupyter Notebook that contains a code that provides a comprehensive analysis of the dataset,
including data loading, exploration, visualization, and preprocessing. The scatter plots are particularly useful for
understanding the relationships between different variables in the dataset. The data preprocessing steps aim to filter
the data based on certain conditions and remove unnecessary columns.
